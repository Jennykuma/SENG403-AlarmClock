//The comments are for your convienence only. There will be no comments in the actual save file
//Each variable is on a new line (thats how we will differentiate one variable from another)
//Date, repeating daily and weekly are for later user stories but it is still a good idea to save it 
//End of each alarm will be signified by the line "EOA"
//End of file will be signified by the line "EOF" (new variables may/may not be added in the future)
